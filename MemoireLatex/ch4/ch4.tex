\section{Introduction}
Before start reading, i want to give you the main idea about this chapter. its contain our approach of transformation from omacs into pns in section \ref{sec:OMACS into PNS}, and the second approach in section \ref{sec:xml}, and the optimazation process in section \ref{sec:optim}.

\section{Implementation of the Transformation (OMACS into PNS)\label{sec:OMACS into PNS} }% Our Work
To Transform OMACS Model into PNS Model, we start to :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define OMACS Meta-Model 
\item Define PNS Meta-Model
\item Define the rules of Transformation
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{OMACS} 
\subsubsection{Meta Model of OMACS}
\vspace{0.5cm}
To define OMACS meta model, we first load the Class Diagramm Formalism, to be able to create, manipulate our Meta-Model,
in OMACS Meta-Model contain set of classes:
\pagebreak
\begin{itemize}
	\item Agent  : we assign the work for this node (Entitie) to do 
	\item Capabilities : we add this node to the agent to be able to do a work
	\item Role : this is the work we assign for the agent 
	\item Goal : we want the agent reach this node 
\end{itemize}

	\caption{\label{fig:OMACS Meta-Model}OMACS Meta-Model}
\end{figure} 
\vspace{0.9cm}
figure \ref{fig:OMACS Meta-Model} illustrate OMACS Meta-Model  contain 4 classes 
and 4 relation   
the Attribute Name in the classes represent the name of current node ,
and the rate attribute in the relation between classes represent  the relation percentage between two node or entities.

For example between an Agent and Capabilities its means how mush this Agent possese this capibilites
\pagebreak
\subsubsection{Example of OMACS}

Starting from  Meta-Model of OMACS in figure  \ref{fig:OMACS Meta-Model}, $AToM^3$ generate a formalism of OMACS, this formalism allow us to create our OMACS Model (Multi Agent System).

 	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{ch3/img/omacs_model}
	\caption{\label{fig:OMACS Model}Formalism for OMACS Generated by $AToM^3$ }
\end{figure} 

Example in this figure \ref{fig:OMACS Model} represent a Multi Agent system which is  a component of 2 agent and 3 Capabilities, 2 Roles, 2 Goals

\subsection{PNS} 
\subsubsection{Meta Model of PNS}
To define PNS meta model, we first load the Class Diagramm Formalism, and its contain 4 classes and Relation
represent: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Raw Material : represent a node does not have input arc 
	\item Intermediare Material 
	\item Final Product : this is the product of the system 
	\item Operating Unit : represent the task or operating which is consume the input material and produce the output material 
\end{itemize}
\pagebreak
\begin{figure}[th] 

	\centering
 	\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{ch3/img/pns_meta}
	\caption{\label{fig:PNS Meta-Model}PNS Meta-Model}
	
\end{figure} 

all material in figure \ref{fig:PNS Meta-Model} containt the same Attribute
\begin{itemize}


\item \textit{Name} : name of Material 
\item \textit{Price} : Price of Material
\item \textit{ReqFlow} : Requirment Flow means how much you have from this material in this system
\item \textit{MaxFlow} : Maximum Flow means how much your system can handle

\end{itemize}



and for the Operating Unit contain 3 Attribute : 
\begin{itemize}

\item Name : name of this Task 
\item Operating Cost Fix  : cost for entire period, Example : year
\item Operating Cost Proportional  :  cost for every Operating from this unit

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Example of PNS}
The  $AToM^3$ Tools  generate a formalism from the meta model we create before, load it and use it like figure \ref{fig:PNS Model} 

\begin{figure}[th]
	\centering
 	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{ch3/img/pns_model}
	\caption{\label{fig:PNS Model}ToolBar for PNS Generated by $AToM^3$}
\end{figure} 

the previous figure \ref{fig:PNS Model} represent system de production contain 2 raw material and one intermediate material, final product and 3 operating unit.

\subsection{Transformation Rules}
A Graph grammar is a grammar consisting of a set of rules, allow to 
Transform a formalisms of the same nature or of a different nature. 

Each Rule is composed of two parts, the left part (LHS) and the right part (RHS).
Each part can be a subgraph of the formalisms considered in the transformation

in our work, the formalisms considered in the transformation are formalism
OMACS as source graph to be transformed into PNS as target graph.

This grammar is defined using the AToM$^3$ tool according to the following step

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Load OMACS and PNS meta-models
	\item Create the transformation grammar
	\item Define the rules of grammar
	\item Generate the executable file of the grammar
\end{enumerate}

Our grammar is composed of :
\begin{description}
	\item [{Rules :}]  each rule is characterized
	by a name and execution priority. They are classified in 04 categories :
\end{description}


\paragraph{\emph{1)~Collect Categorie :} } 
Rules for Collect and create relation between some entitie
 
\paragraph{\emph{2)~Transform Categorie:} } 
Rules for transforming nodes or links into materials or operating units.
 

\paragraph{\emph{3)~Links Categorie:} } 
Rules to links generated materials and operating units 

\paragraph{\emph{4)~Cleaning Categorie:} } 
Rules to cleaning unnecessary entities from the result 

\end{enumerate}
our approach contain 20 rules, i mentions the most important transformation rules into the following steps  : 
\begin{itemize}

\item Create link between the agent and role depending on the common capabilites

\item Generate for every agent in OMACS Model into raw material in PNS Model
and the generated material has the same name and price 

\item Generate for every goal in OMACS Model into intermediate material in PNS Model and the generated material has the same name  


\item The product in the target graph which is PNS Model represent the organization of the OMACS Model

\item Create Operating unit for each direct link between the role and an agent 

\item Link the material was generated from goal with final product by operating unit

\end{itemize}


\paragraph{\emph{1)~Agent2RoleLink1 : Create the direct link  between the Agent and the Role (order 1) :} } The Figure \ref{fig:Create link between Agent and Role} illustrate how to create link between the agent and role depending on commun capabilities, order 1 mean it is the first rule applied in the grammar.

After that you notice some word in the rules like  :
\begin{itemize}
\item Left hand side
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item ANY : its attribue in the node and the engine will select every node with ANY attribute value
	\end{enumerate}
\item  Right hand side
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item COPIED : copie the attribue value from the node with same GGLabel in LHS
	\item SPECIFIED : specified the attribue value manualy or by code 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
 
Now it's supposed to be aware every rule has a condition must be true  before the engine run this rule, i mention some these condition in the next part.
\pagebreak
\paragraph{\emph{1)~Condition for the rule   Assign Role to Agent  :  } } 
 
Test if there is a node agent, role visited before 
in order not to fall in infinity loop, figure \ref{fig:Create link between Agent and Role} represent the rule.

\paragraph{\emph{2)~Condition for Create Final Stat : } } 
This conditon test if this attribute Final stat equal zero 
, in other word we did not visite this rule before, the rule in figure\ref{fig:Create the final material}.

\subsection{Examples }

\subsubsection{Simple multi Agent System }
This example represents a very simple system composed of  two agent and 3 capabilities, 2 role and 2 goals.
 Figure \ref{fig:Example 1 Multi Agent System } illustrates this example :
\begin{figure}[th]
	\centering
 	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{ch3/img/omacs_model}
	\caption{\label{fig:Example 1 Multi Agent System }Example 1 Multi Agent System}
\end{figure} 
\pagebreak
The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the transformation of multi agent system in OMACS into pns model

Figure \ref{fig:Multi Agent System After transformation } shows the transformation result.
It is clear that the resulting contain set of material and operating unit
 
\begin{itemize}
\item The raw material A1, A2 represent the agent  
\item The operating unit A1 R1 represent the relation between an A1 and R1 
in Mas before the transformation its the same for other entities like this one
\item the operating unit and material named A2 R2 G2 represent agent A2 Playing R2 in order to achieve G2, it is the same for other entities  

\item the operating unit and material named A2 R2 G2 represent agent A2 Playing R2 in order to achieve G2 


\item the operating unit and material named A1 R1 G2 represent agent A1 Playing R1 in order to achieve G2  and G2, any agent in this is capable to play R1 can reach G1 and G2
 

\end{itemize}

\end{figure} 

\begin{itemize}
	\item every agent possesses set of capabilites for example A1 possese all capabilies in the system
	\item Role require list of capabilies every agent has the same capabilies or more, so he can play this role
	\item Role R1, R2 achieve all goal in the system
	\item the Agent A1 all capabilites in the system so we can say, A1 capable of playing R1 and R2
	\item Agent A1 capable of playing all roles in this system, so he can achieve all goal in the system
\end{itemize}
\vspace{2cm}

after the Transformation of Multi agent system from OMACS frame into PNS framework we get this model in figure \ref{fig:Complex Multi Agent System After transforamtion} 
and next table represent the value of this model

\section{Transformation Approach ( PNS into XML file )\label{sec:xml} }
In Section \ref{sec:OMACS into PNS} we presented our transformation approach That allows 
to transform the OMACS to PNS.

The purpose of this transformation is the Optimization and for this we
Proposed Another processing approach That transforms PNS to XML 
files to analysis for a optimization tool 
\subsection{ Graph Grammar }
 this grammar is Composed of three parts: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Initial Action : } This portion of our grammar is used to initialize all
Global variables used. They are used to meet various needs.  in Figure \ref{fig:Code Initial Action} 

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[th]
	\centering  %[scale=1.2]
 	\includegraphics[scale=0.38]{ch3/img/InitAct}
	\caption{\label{fig:Code Initial Action}Code Initial Action}
\end{figure} 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Final Action : } Final Action Allows Completing the.xml file by the tags
XML Completing the after-processing of all PNS nodes and save the page name. in figure \ref{fig:Code Final Action} 
   
\end{itemize}

\end{figure} 
\pagebreak
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ Set of Rules : } 
 
Our grammar graphs Consists of ten rules. Each
rule is Characterized by a name and an execution priority. 

\end{itemize}
 We quote here The Most major rules: 
\paragraph{\emph{1)~Transform RawMaterial into XML code :} }
This rule (Figure \ref{fig:Raw Material into Xml}) to priority equal to "1", ie, 
it is the first rule applied on the Model. She transforms the place into a XML

like you see in the first line i import MyFunction is external file, Python code 
to be easy to manipulate  and this is the function to add new material ( raw, intermadiate, final)
and for the operating unit is the similair function

	return node

\paragraph{\emph{2)~Transform Edge between two entitie into XML code :} } in this transformation 
we want to create link between nodes Material and Operating unit 
and we have  4 type of Edges : 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Edges from raw material into Operating unit
	\item Edges from intermediate material into Operating unit
	
	\item Edges from  Operating unit into final material
	\item Edges from  Operating unit into intermadiate material

\section{Optimisation Multi Agent System \label{sec:optim} }

To optimize the multi-agent system in  Process Process synthesis, we chose tool called  P-Graph Studio 

\textbf{P-Graph Studio : }   is a software that implements algorithms MSG, SSG, and ABB, and therefore, it is primarily
used as a solver for process synthesis problems. Furthermore, it is also capable of constructing process synthesis models.
As a modeling tool, it uses a tree-view that provides a clear overview of the actual problem under consideration and makes
it possible to edit the properties of multiple materials and operating units in parallel. The handling of measurement units
is aided with automated conversions. \cite{ ch3-pgraph2, Sitepgraph}

As a solver, PNS Studio can generate the maximal structure, the combinatorial feasible structures, and the globally optimal
and suboptimal solutions of the problem. In the latter case the objective can be either cost minimization or profit max-
imization. PNS Studio provides a double pane view of solutions to compare alternatives.
Models and initial structures created in PNS Drawn can be imported into PNS Studio where they can be further edited. It
is also possible to export brief or more detailed reports from PNS Studio to Microsoft Excel. \cite{ch3-pgraph}

\begin{figure}[th]

 	\includegraphics[scale=0.44]{ch3/img/pgraph}
