  Abstract                 = {In this paper we study the robust PNS problem, which is the extension of the
structural PNS problem used to model process network synthesis. This problem is NP-hard
thus a heuristic algorithm can be very useful for large instances, where we do not have
enough time for an exponential time algorithm, presenting a surely optimal solution, or
they can be used to fasten branch and bound based algorithms. We present new heuristic
algorithms for the solution of the problem which are extensions of the heuristic algorithms
used to solve the classical structural PNS problem. The algorithms are analyzed
empirically, where we compare the efficiency on randomly generated inputs.},

with other agents to adapt its local environment. And the organizational level (macro-level) in which the whole system changes it
structure by adding or removing agents. This chapter is dedicated to overview different aspects of what is called MAS
Organization including its motivations, paradigms, models, and techniques adopted for statically or dynamically organizing

the feasible combinations of structures, i.e., OMACS-based design configurations, capable
of yielding the specified products from the specified raw material; (ii) every feasible
structure for the process of interest; and (iii) the optimal structure of the network, i.e., the
optimal OMACS-based design configuration. Finally, in light of the tenet of a modeling-
transformation-evaluation paradigm, an appraisal is made of the feasibility as well as the
flexibility and cost of the optimal OMACS-based design configuration obtained.},

means of a P-graph model, which is then transformed into a time-expanded process network synthesis
(PNS T ) problem that can be algorithmically handled by the P-graph framework. In the proposed
method, each location in the building and their passages are given by a set of attributes to be taken in
the evacuation route planning. In addition to the globally optimal solution of the building evacuation
problem, the P-graph framework provides the n-best suboptimal solutions, when computational
possible. The viability of the proposed model is illustrated by an example.},

systems using an organizational model, which defines the
entities and relationships of a typical organization. The
major elements of the model consist of goals, roles, agents,
capabilities, and the relationships between them. By
designing a system using the model, the system can
determine the best mapping of agents to roles, based on
their current capabilities, for the current system goals.
Specifically, we show how to use the model in developing
an adaptive information system, which is an information
system that can modify its processing algorithms or
information sources to provide required information at
various levels of efficiency and effectiveness.},

based on the Organization Model for Adaptive Computational Systems, which defines the knowledge required for the system
to be able to self-organize. Furthermore, a customized development process based on the Organization-based Multiagent
Systems Engineering framework supports our approach. To illustrate the process, we describe the design of one autonomic
system, the Autonomic Information System, and exemplify how this system fulfills desired autonomic properties. We also
evaluate the performance of our autonomic system by comparing it to a non-autonomic system},

  Abstract                 = {Multiagent systems have become popular over the last few years for building complex, adaptive
systems in a distributed, heterogeneous setting. Multiagent systems tend to be more robust and, in
many cases, more efficient than single monolithic applications. However, unpredictable
application environments make multiagent systems susceptible to individual failures that can
significantly reduce its ability to accomplish its overall goal. The problem is that multiagent
systems are typically designed to work within a limited set of configurations. Even when the
system possesses the resources and computational power to accomplish its goal, it may be
constrained by its own structure and knowledge of its member’s capabilities. To overcome these
problems, we are developing a framework that allows the system to design its own organization at
runtime. This paper presents a key component of that framework, a metamodel for multiagent
organizations named the Organization Model for Adaptive Computational Systems. This model
defines the requisite knowledge of a system’s organizational structure and capabilities that will
allow it to reorganize at runtime and enable it to achieve its goals effectively in the face of a
changing environment and its agent’s capabilities.},

Algorithm MSG is effective in synthesizing a large industrial process since its complexity
grows merely polynomially with the size of the synthesized process. Another algorithm,
algorithm SSG, generates the set of feasible process structures from the maximal structure; it
leads to additional combinatorial algorithms of process synthesis including those for
decomposition and for accelerating branch and bound search. These algorithms have also
proved themselves to be efficient in solving large industrial synthesis problems.},
