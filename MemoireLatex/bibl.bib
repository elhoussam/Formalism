  Abstract                 = {The primary aim of process-network synthesis, or PNS in short, is to determine the best process network
achieving a desired goal, e.g., producing a set of desired products or satisfy demands. PNS has a long history, and numerous
methods for executing it are available. Its acceleratedly increasing importance can be attributed to the need to respond to the
rapid emergence of new technologies and fast changes in the economic environment. It is highly desirable that any corporation
be able to ascertain if a new technology is viable for its business as well as to assess if its current technology remains sustainable in
the changing environment. Herein, a novel method and software for PNS are proposed for generating, optimizing, and analyzing
alternative process designs at the conceptual level. The method is illustrated by synthesizing alternative process designs with
different network structures for the production of butanol, ethanol, and acetone from grains. Furthermore, the sustainability of
the resultant process designs is analyzed. This is executed by varying the payout period and the production rate, i.e., load.},

empirically, where we compare the efficiency on randomly generated inputs.},

generates the maximal structure (super-structure) of a process synthesis problem; it can also be
the basic algorithm in generating a mathematical programming model for this problem.
Algorithm MSG is effective in synthesizing a large industrial process since its complexity
grows merely polynomially with the size of the synthesized process. Another algorithm,
algorithm SSG, generates the set of feasible process structures from the maximal structure; it
leads to additional combinatorial algorithms of process synthesis including those for
decomposition and for accelerating branch and bound search. These algorithms have also
proved themselves to be efficient in solving large industrial synthesis problems.},

approach and testing approach. We are interested in testing approach. First,
we propose an automated approach to determinize DATA structure with a
high number of states. We propose also an approach for translating DATA*
structure to aggregate region automaton. The purpose of this transformation
is to provide a nite abstraction of DATA* with a high number of states.
Finally, we propose an approach for testing timed systems. Indeed, we trans-
form a DATA* into GRA in order to generate a canonical tester and test
cases. These approaches are based on graph transformation using the mode-
ling tool AT oM 3},

Transformation Graph (FTG), proposed by the authors. To aid in the
automatic generation of multi-formalism modelling tools, formalisms are
modelled in their own right (at a meta-level) within an appropriate for-
malism. This has been implemented in the interactive tool AToM 3 . This
tool is used to describe formalisms commonly used in the simulation of
dynamical systems, as well as to generate custom tools to process (cre-
ate, edit, transform, simulate, optimise, ...) models expressed in the cor-
responding formalism. AToM 3 relies on graph rewriting techniques and
graph grammars to perform the transformations between formalisms as
well as for other tasks, such as code generation and operational seman-

meta-modelling and graph grammars for the generation
of visual modelling tools for simulation formalisms. In
meta-modelling, formalisms are described at a meta-
level. This information is used by a meta-model processor
to generate modelling tools for the described formalisms.
We combine meta-modelling with graph grammars to
extend the model manipulation capabilities of the gen-
erated modelling tools: edit, simulate, transform into
another formalism, optimize and generate code. We store
all (meta-)models as graphs, and thus, express model ma-
nipulations as graph grammars.
We present the design and implementation of these
concepts in AToM 3 (A Tool for Multi-formalism, Meta-
Modelling). AToM 3 supports modelling of complex sys-
tems using different formalisms, all meta-modelled in
their own right. Models in different formalisms may be
transformed into a single common formalism for fur-
ther processing. These transformations are specified by
graph grammars. Mosterman and Vangheluwe [18] in-
troduced the term multi-paradigm modelling to denote
the combination of multiple formalisms, multiple ab-
straction levels, and meta-modelling. As an example of
multi-paradigm modelling we present a meta-model for
the Object-Oriented Continuous Simulation Language
OOCSMP, in which we combine ideas from UML class
diagrams (to express the OOCSMP model structure),
Causal Block Diagrams (CBDs), and Statecharts (to
specify the methods of the OOCSMP classes). A graph
grammar is able to generate OOCSMP code, and then
a compiler for this language (C-OOL) generates Java ap-
plets for the simulation execution.},

systems using an organizational model, which defines the
entities and relationships of a typical organization. The
major elements of the model consist of goals, roles, agents,
capabilities, and the relationships between them. By
designing a system using the model, the system can
determine the best mapping of agents to roles, based on
their current capabilities, for the current system goals.
Specifically, we show how to use the model in developing
an adaptive information system, which is an information
system that can modify its processing algorithms or
information sources to provide required information at
various levels of efficiency and effectiveness.},

to be able to self-organize. Furthermore, a customized development process based on the Organization-based Multiagent
Systems Engineering framework supports our approach. To illustrate the process, we describe the design of one autonomic
system, the Autonomic Information System, and exemplify how this system fulfills desired autonomic properties. We also
evaluate the performance of our autonomic system by comparing it to a non-autonomic system},

  Abstract                 = {Multiagent systems have become popular over the last few years for building complex, adaptive
systems in a distributed, heterogeneous setting. Multiagent systems tend to be more robust and, in
many cases, more efficient than single monolithic applications. However, unpredictable
application environments make multiagent systems susceptible to individual failures that can
significantly reduce its ability to accomplish its overall goal. The problem is that multiagent
systems are typically designed to work within a limited set of configurations. Even when the
system possesses the resources and computational power to accomplish its goal, it may be
constrained by its own structure and knowledge of its member‚Äôs capabilities. To overcome these
problems, we are developing a framework that allows the system to design its own organization at
runtime. This paper presents a key component of that framework, a metamodel for multiagent
organizations named the Organization Model for Adaptive Computational Systems. This model
defines the requisite knowledge of a system‚Äôs organizational structure and capabilities that will
allow it to reorganize at runtime and enable it to achieve its goals effectively in the face of a
changing environment and its agent‚Äôs capabilities.},

  Abstract                 = {The emergence of large-scale computer networks has given rise to many
distributed applications. These applications require a close interaction between different
entities distributed over the network and share the same resources and the same goals.
Several models for distributed execution of these applications have been proposed in the
literature. Among them, the model of mobile agent offers a solution that facilitates the
development of distributed applications. Indeed, a mobile agent is an autonomous entity
able to react on its environment and on it self, by moving from one network site to
another to reach its objectives.
It appears clearly, that the technology of code mobility is one of the most
attractive areas of research. However, the poorness of modeling languages to deal with
code mobility at requirement phase has incited the researchers to suggest new
formalisms. Among these, we find Labeled Reconfigurable Net (LRN). We propose an
approach and a tool for automatic transformation of LRN models to their equivalent
R-Maude specifications. This transformation aims to make it possible to verify
properties of systems modeled using the LRN, as this new formalism has no tools for
analysis and verification. Our approach is based on the combined use of meta-modeling
and graph grammars. In our work, the formalism of UML class diagram tool ATOM3 is
used to define a meta-model for the LRN. ATOM3 is also used to generate a visual
modeling tool for developing models according to the proposed metamodel of LRN. We
have also proposed a graph grammar to automatically generate the R-Maude description
for the LRN models, graphically specified. Then, the rewriting logic R-Maude is used to
perform the simulation of the generated specification},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A computer-aided methodology for designing sustainable supply chains is presented using the P-graph framework to develop supply chain structures which are analyzed using cost, the cost of producing electricity, and two sustainability metrics: ecological footprint and emergy. They represent environmental burden in terms of land use and energy resources. The P-graph framework provides a mathematically rigorous procedure for synthesizing optimal and alternative networks subject to profitability considering ecological footprint and emergy inputs. Emergy is a measure of energy used in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or maintain a service, or in our case, energy production. Emergy and ecological footprint complement each other because they represent very different aspects of sustainability. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with a supply chain whichprovides electric power and heat to an agricultural region utilizing agricultural wastes as renewable resources. The results indicate that, compared to electricity from the grid and/or natural gas, renewable energy resources can yield cost reductions of up to 17 % as well as ecological footprint and emergy reductions. This allows the design of more sustainable supply chains that are both cost-effective and less environmentally damaging. },
