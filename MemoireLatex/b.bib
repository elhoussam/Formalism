  Abstract                 = {The P-graph framework is proven to be highly effective in solving Process Network Synthesis. In the present work, the P-graph framework has been adopted for solving the routing and scheduling of evacuees, facing a life-threatening situation. First the building evacuation problem is represented by means of a P-graph model, which is then transformed into a time-expanded process network synthesis (PNST) problem that can be algorithmically handled by the P-graph framework. In the proposed method, each location in the building and their passages are given by a set of attributes to be taken in the evacuation route planning. In addition to the globally optimal solution of the building evacuation problem, the P-graph framework provides the n-best suboptimal solutions, when computational possible. The viability of the proposed model is illustrated by an example. Copyright © 2012, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

  Abstract                 = {Formal methods are increasingly used to meet the requirements of cri-
tical systems. They oer several approaches : behavioral approach, logical
approach and testing approach. We are interested in testing approach. First,
we propose an automated approach to determinize DATA structure with a
high number of states. We propose also an approach for translating DATA*
structure to aggregate region automaton. The purpose of this transformation
is to provide a nite abstraction of DATA* with a high number of states.
Finally, we propose an approach for testing timed systems. Indeed, we trans-
form a DATA* into GRA in order to generate a canonical tester and test
cases. These approaches are based on graph transformation using the mode-
ling tool AT oM 3},

  Abstract                 = {The emergence of large-scale computer networks has given rise to many
distributed applications. These applications require a close interaction between different
entities distributed over the network and share the same resources and the same goals.
Several models for distributed execution of these applications have been proposed in the
literature. Among them, the model of mobile agent offers a solution that facilitates the
development of distributed applications. Indeed, a mobile agent is an autonomous entity
able to react on its environment and on it self, by moving from one network site to
another to reach its objectives.
It appears clearly, that the technology of code mobility is one of the most
attractive areas of research. However, the poorness of modeling languages to deal with
code mobility at requirement phase has incited the researchers to suggest new
formalisms. Among these, we find Labeled Reconfigurable Net (LRN). We propose an
approach and a tool for automatic transformation of LRN models to their equivalent
R-Maude specifications. This transformation aims to make it possible to verify
properties of systems modeled using the LRN, as this new formalism has no tools for
analysis and verification. Our approach is based on the combined use of meta-modeling
and graph grammars. In our work, the formalism of UML class diagram tool ATOM3 is
used to define a meta-model for the LRN. ATOM3 is also used to generate a visual
modeling tool for developing models according to the proposed metamodel of LRN. We
have also proposed a graph grammar to automatically generate the R-Maude description
for the LRN models, graphically specified. Then, the rewriting logic R-Maude is used to
perform the simulation of the generated specification},
