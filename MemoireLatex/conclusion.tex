Through this paper, we saw out objective was to optimise a multi agent system 
and this MaS represented according the OMACS framework.

We have introduce  in the first chapter the definition of elements and the relation between these element in OMACS.

The Second chapter was the  PGraph Framework and  Process Network Synthesis, the basic concept and mathematical definition  of this framework, and i mention 
three algorithm applicable on PNS 

In the Third chapter, we mention the main concept of transformation model. followed by an overview about the Tool $AToM^3$ that tool allow us to define the meta model and generate a formalism from these meta model, and use formalism to create ot modelise you own model. 

In the fourth chapter, we presented our approach for transforam MaS in OMACS presentation into PNS Model, we start with defining the meta model for both framework i use (OMACS and PNS)

the next step it is to define a graph grammar that allows to transform from source graph in this case is OMACS model into target graph (PNS model), after execute this transforamtion we can not be used directly for optimisation with the existing tools, for thsi we have to propose another approach to transforam the model in PNS into xml file.

Now we can import the xml file into the PGraph-Studio and apply the Algorithm of  optimisation.
