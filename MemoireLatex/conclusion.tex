Through our project, We explained the aim of our project wchich is to find the optimum organization of multi agent system 
, and this later represented according the OMACS framework.

We have introduce in the first chapter, Motivation and some conception of organization and reorganization in MaS and we cite 2 Framework, 
allow us to design a MaS and we focus on OMACS framework because it is support reorganization process.

The Second chapter was the PGraph Framework and Process Network Synthesis, the basic concept and mathematical definition  of this framework, and i mention 
three algorithm applicable on PNS 

In the Third chapter, we cite the concept of model transformation approaches and we concentrate on the Graph transformation approach, followed by an overview about the Tool AToM3, it is allow us to define the meta model and generate a formalism from these meta model.

In the fourth chapter, we presented our approach for transforam MaS in OMACS presentation into PNS Model, we start with defining the meta model for both framework i use (OMACS and PNS)

we propose 2 transformation approach. The first approach its to transform from OMACS Model into PNS Model and the second its to transform the last output (PNS Model) into xml file, the we pass the result which xml file into PGraph studio to apply the algorithm of optimization.
