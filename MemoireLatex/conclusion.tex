Through our project, We explained the aim of our project wchich is to find the optimum organization of multi agent system, and this later represented according the OMACS framework.

We have introduced in the first chapter, Motivation and some concept of organization and reorganization in MaS and we presented two frameworks (OMACS, PNS), that allow us to design a MaS.

The Second chapter was about the PGraph Framework and Process Network Synthesis, the basic concept and mathematical definition  of this framework, and we mentioned 
three algorithm applicable on PNS 

In the Third chapter, we explained the concept of model transformation approaches and we concentrated on the Graph transformation approach, followed by an overview about the Tool AToM3, it allow us to define the meta model and generate a formalism from these meta model.

In the fourth chapter, we presented our approach to transform a MaS modeled in OMACS presentation into PNS Model, and 
we defined the meta model for both frameworks (OMACS, PNS), 
we propose two approach, the (OMACS TO PNS) approach, to transform OMACS model into PNS model, and the second approach  to transform the generated ons model by the first approach into XML file, to be able to apply ABB in PGraph Studio to find the best (optimum) structure.

Our work depend on a tool called PGraph studio, to apply the (Branch \& Bound) algorithm, because of that we propose as a perspective to implement ABB algorithm using graph grammar to make our approaches autonomous.
